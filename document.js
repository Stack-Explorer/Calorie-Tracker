// Frontend
// CaloriesBurnt.jsx

/*
Initial State
calories = '' (input is empty)
submitted = false (user hasnâ€™t submitted yet)
isEditing = false (not in edit mode)
Before Submission
UI shows an input field and a Submit button.
Render condition: !submitted is true.
After Submit
submitted is set to true.
Since isEditing is still false, it displays:
The entered calorie value (e.g., 200 cal burnt)
An Edit button.
On Edit
isEditing becomes true.
UI switches back to an input field (pre-filled with the calorie value) and a Save button.
On Save
isEditing becomes false again.
Shows updated value with a success toast and Edit button.
Conditional Rendering Order
Logic flow is:
jsx
Copy
Edit
if (!submitted) {
  // Show input + Submit
} else {
  if (!isEditing) {
    // Show static text + Edit
  } else {
    // Show input + Save
  }
}
This ensures the UI behaves cleanly as the state changes.
